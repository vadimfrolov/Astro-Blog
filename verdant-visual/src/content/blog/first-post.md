Last week, I attended 2Ô∏è‚É£ hackathons simultaneously: the OpenAI Open Model Hackathon and Code with Kiro Hackathon üßë‚Äçüíª. The result? A local-first AI-powered planner that exceeded my expectations!

It was fascinating to dive into the world of specification-driven AI development and local LLM models. Here are my key takeaways:

üîß **Ollama is much easier to use than I initially thought!** Setting up local LLM models and connecting them to a local API was surprisingly straightforward.

üí° **Kiro is specification driven AI IDE made by Amazon.** I really liked new approach with predictable results and well made documentation! It's definitely a way to reduce hallucinations and get better flow.

‚ö° **The gpt-oss-20b model from OpenAI is working pretty impressive and offline!** I was more than satisfied with the planning capabilities it delivered.

This experience reinforced my belief that local-first AI solutions are the future. The combination of privacy, performance, and reliability is compelling, especially for productivity tools.

What's your experience with local AI models? Have you tried building anything similar?
