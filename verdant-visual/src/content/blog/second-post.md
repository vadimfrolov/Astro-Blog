AI coding assistants now need less help with Chrome DevTools Model Context Protocol.

For years, there's been a fundamental problem: AI agents generate code but can't actually see what it does when it runs in the browser, developer was constantly asked to tell what he can find in a console during debugging.

**A couple of weeks ago, that changed.**

Chrome DevTools MCP gives AI assistants real-time visibility into your web applications. They can now debug directly in Chrome, spot network errors, diagnose performance issues, and verify their fixes actually workâ€”without you having to manually test everything.

## The Game Changer

Think about what this unlocks: Your AI assistant doesn't just generate code anymore. It generates code, tests it, sees what breaks in real browser, and fixes it. All in real-time.

This is a massive leap forward for AI-assisted development. No more back-and-forth where you have to describe console errors or network failures to your AI assistant. It can see everything you see in DevTools.

## What's Next?

Can't wait for new advanced tools for improving performance and testing! The possibilities are endless when AI can directly interact with browser debugging tools.
