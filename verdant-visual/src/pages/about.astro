	<p>
		Hi! I'm Vadim, a Software Engineer since 2018. This is my personal website where I like to 
		share my thoughts and experiences.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm passionate about building great software and delivering the best solutions. I enjoy talking 
		and listening to people, building prototypes, and solving complex problems through code.
	</p>

	<h3>What I'm up to:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>💻 Currently working at Distribusion</li>
		<li>🐕 Proud Corgi owner</li>
		<li>🎞️ Movie enthusiast - I know a lot about movies</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Fun fact: Before diving into web development, I worked as a Civil Engineer for over 7 years. 
		That experience taught me the importance of solid foundations - something that applies just as 
		much to building software as it does to building structures.
	</p>

	<p>
		I love connecting with fellow developers, movie nerds, and anyone interested in technology. 
		Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about code, movies, or anything in between!
